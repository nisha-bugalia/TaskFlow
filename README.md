# TaskFlow
Trello/Notion Lite clone for task management
To be done Today:
1.Adding the user Id----Done
2.removed the assign to from the project box----Done
3.Api to assign the task according to the username---Done
4.Deleting the task---About to done
5.Made the API to fetch the assigned tasks for any projects in the dashboard----Not Done
6.Setting the api to allow those projects to be editted whom the other one is the admin only---Not done


Problem:
1.I am still Facing login with pawanroy2004@gmail.com and password: 123,
2.you will see a that when you add the task in the different status in the board section of each project, first "userId" is 
shown then after their username is shown after reload in the assigne Section.
3.So change it i have set the function in the useeffect to change the user array based where the field is assigne_id to username for the list of the tasks in the As ProjectViewToggle.



I have fixed point 2nd....and the login UI cannot be changed to use the username, because the entire backend logic is built around the user's email not username(I tried but everything get messed up in frontend).

That 5th point you mentioned i have already done that yesterday ..in dashboard we are fetching all tasks not separate tasks of each project 

Please add the delete and update api for tasks asap and if done push them

It is getting really difficult to work like this. I think we should just unblock each other for now...complete the project as soon as possible...and once it is done, we can go our separate ways
